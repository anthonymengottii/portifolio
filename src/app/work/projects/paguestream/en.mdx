## Key Features
- **OBS Integration**: Customizable overlay for displaying donations during streams

- **Visual Notifications**: Animated alerts when a donation is received
- **Streamer Dashboard**: Control panel for donation management and statistics
- **Goals System**: Setting and tracking fundraising goals

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js**: Framework for frontend and backend
- **TypeScript**: Type-safety throughout the entire project
- **WebSockets**: Real-time communication for notifications
- **PIX API**: Integration with the Brazilian instant payment system
- **OBS WebSocket**: Integration with OBS Studio for overlays

## Challenges and Learnings
The biggest challenge was building a system that processes PIX payments and updates the streamer's interface in real time with imperceptible latency. The solution involved WebSockets for bidirectional communication and asynchronous webhook processing.

The OBS integration required in-depth knowledge of the OBS Studio WebSocket API and the creation of HTML/CSS overlays that work flawlessly during live broadcasts.

## Outcome
Fully functional platform that enables streamers to receive PIX donations during their transmissions, with real-time visual notifications. The system significantly improves the monetization experience for Brazilian content creators.
