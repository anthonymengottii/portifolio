## Key Features
- **Integration with 13+ Game Providers**: Support for major suppliers of slots, table games, and live casino
- **5 Payment Gateways**: Integration with multiple payment processors for greater flexibility
- **Complete Affiliate System**: Affiliate marketing platform with tracking, commissions, and reporting
- **Filament 3 Admin Panel**: Modern and intuitive interface for full platform management
- **Vue 3 Frontend**: Reactive and high-performance user interface
- **Laravel 10 Backend**: Robust and scalable API to handle high transaction volumes

## Technologies Used
- **Laravel 10**: PHP framework for backend and API
- **Vue 3**: JavaScript framework for reactive frontend
- **Filament 3**: Modern and customizable admin panel
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL**: Relational database
- **Redis**: High-performance caching and sessions
- **WebSockets**: Real-time communication for live games

## Challenges and Learnings
Integration with multiple game providers required creating a unified abstraction layer, since each provider has different APIs and data formats. We implemented an adapter system that makes adding new providers much easier.

The affiliate system needed to be highly performant to process thousands of clicks and conversions in real time, requiring database optimizations and intelligent caching.

## Outcome
Fully functional white label platform that enables operators to launch their online casinos in just weeks. The system handles thousands of simultaneous players and integrates seamlessly with major market providers.
