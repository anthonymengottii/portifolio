## Overview
The UPay Gateway API is a complete white-label payment platform designed to provide a robust and flexible transaction processing solution. Unlike overly complex platforms, UPay was built by developers for developers, prioritizing simplicity, intuitiveness, and ease of integration.

## Key Features
- **Simple and Intuitive API**: Clear, well-documented endpoints based on intention — each endpoint does exactly what its name suggests
- **Multiple Payment Methods**: Full support for PIX, Credit/Debit Card, and Boleto
- **Personalized Payment Links**: Create unique links with flexible settings for each transaction
- **Complete Product Management**: Full catalog with create, list, update, and delete operations
- **Coupon System**: Complete discount coupon management with real-time validation
- **Real-Time Webhooks**: Receive instant notifications about payment events
- **Administrative Dashboard**: Full control over transactions, reports, and settings
- **Idempotent API**: Execute the same request multiple times with no side effects
- **Consistent Responses**: Standardized structure makes error handling and integration straightforward

## Technologies Used
- **TypeScript**: Type-safety and improved developer experience
- **Node.js**: Runtime for high-performance processing
- **Next.js**: Framework for the admin interface and documentation
- **RESTful Architecture**: Modern and well-structured REST API
- **Mintlify Documentation**: Interactive and comprehensive developer documentation

## Challenges and Learnings
The main challenge was creating an API that was extremely simple to use without sacrificing robustness and flexibility. The solution was to develop an intention-based architecture where each endpoint clearly represents its purpose, eliminating the ambiguities common in other platforms.

Implementing idempotency ensured developers could safely retry requests multiple times without concern, significantly improving the integration experience and reducing production errors.

## Outcome
The UPay Gateway API is live in production, processing real transactions through a [complete and interactive documentation](https://upayltda.mintlify.app/pages/introduction). The platform offers fast integration with step-by-step guides, code examples in multiple languages, and dedicated support, allowing developers to start processing payments in minutes.
