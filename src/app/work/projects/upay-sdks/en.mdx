  # Upay Official SDKs
</div>
Official set of libraries developed to facilitate developers' integration with the Upay payment platform. Available for the main backend languages on the market.

## Supported Languages
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** (`@upay/upay-js`)
- **Python** (`upay-python`)
- **PHP** (`upay/upay-php`)

## Implemented Features
The SDKs abstract the complexity of HTTP calls and authentication, offering typed and intuitive methods for:
- **Payment Links**: Full creation and management
- **Transactions**: Query and listing with filters
- **Products and Customers**: Catalog and customer base management
- **Coupons**: Validation and application of discounts
- **Webhooks**: Signature verification for secure event processing

## Usage Example (TypeScript)
```typescript
import UpayClient from '@upay/upay-js';
const upay = new UpayClient({
  apiKey: 'your_secret_api_key'
});
// Create a payment link in 3 lines
const paymentLink = await upay.paymentLinks.create({
  title: 'Premium Subscription',
  amount: 9990, // R$ 99.90
  description: 'Monthly access to the platform'
});
console.log(paymentLink.checkoutUrl);
```

## Documentation
Each SDK comes with dedicated documentation including installation and usage examples, significantly speeding up the setup time for new partners and integrators.
